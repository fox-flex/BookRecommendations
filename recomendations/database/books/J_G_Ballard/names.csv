Typed letter signed from Ballard to Cokeliss, 3 December 1970 (2 sheets). 'Am still working on the script, which should be with you by monday morning. However, from your point of view here are the basic scenes which you will need, either for live filming with myself, or from existing newsreel material.' Ten numbered 'scenes' follow, the first six of which are marked with an asterisk (blue ink) as 'those which you might want me to appear in'; (3). Draft script by Ballard. 10 sheets typed [December 1970]. The draft is entitled: 'Crash', prepared 'for Harley Cokeliss / Review / BBC-TV'. The first page of the script is annotated in the hand of Cokeliss, against the scene 'Ballard driving his car along highway': 'shoot at Dusk just as lights goes [sic] on'; (4). 'Camera Script'. BBC document (9 sheets, yellow paper). The Camera Script includes the introduction by the programme's editor and presenter, James Mossman ('Jim'). Transmission: 12 February 1971; (5).

Annotations to the proof do not appear to be in Ballard's hand (e.g. question reformulated, green ink, sheet 5). The interviewer (styled in the proofs as simply 'Penthouse') was Lynn Barber. The interview as published is reprinted in Sellars and O'Hara (eds.), Extreme Metaphors: Interviews with J.G. Ballard 1967-2008 (2012).

The artist referred to in this description is Edward Kienholz (1927-1994). The performance, to be narrated by Chris Evans, did not take place, although it was publicised in advance in a feature article in the Sunday Mirror (19 May 1968) by June Rose: 'Dr Christopher Evans, an experimental psychologist, and science fiction writer James Ballard have spent many months exploring the 'hidden meaning' of car accidents for their dramatic presentation entitled Crash [...] Sculptor Eduoard Palozzi [sic] will make the dummy figures for Crash, and Dr Evans will narrate and explain the significance of the action on stage.'.

Ballard's novels, in manuscript and in typescript, excepting The Wind from Nowhere (1962) and The Unlimited Dream Company (1979). It includes, for some novels, related notes and synoptic material, and also includes notes Ballard made towards the end of his life for writing projects that were not completed (for the later notes, see Add MS 88938/27). For four text collages completed in the late 1950s (usually referred to as 'Project for a New Novel'), see Add MS 88938/3/3. Ballard did not retain the texts of his short stories (including the chapters of The Atrocity Exhibition). There are two exceptions to the absence of short story material in the collection: a cutting (1951) of the Varsity competition-winning story 'The Violent Noon' (Add MS 88938/3/1), and a draft text of an unpublished (and undated) story set in Vermilion Sands (Add MS 88938/3/2). There is a limited range of personal items (certificates of birth, baptism, and marriage, two passports, some school reports, and a selection of photographs). Almost all the correspondence in the collection derives from the last two decades of Ballard's life; however, there are two letters (1964) from Ballard's wife, Mary, to his sister, Margaret (see Add MS 88938/1/6), which make reference to publication matters and to Ballard's writing. The collection includes the texts of a number of interviews conducted by fax (1997-2007), and some exhibition-related material (including posthumous events). Various documents in Ballard's papers concerning Lunghua Camp derive from the papers of William Braidwood, Chairman of the British Residents' Association (Shanghai). They include Minutes of Residents' Association meetings, and documentation of the physical conditions endured by Camp internees. Ballard received the material from Margaret Braidwood in 1996, some considerable time after the publication of Empire of the Sun . For these papers, see Add MS 88938/2/1/7. For a selection of letters to Ballard from Lunghua Camp internees, sent to the author following the publication of Empire of the Sun, see Add MS 88938/2/1/6. Secondary material includes adaptations of Ballard's work by David Leland (Running Wild) and by Simon David Eden (Vermilion Sands), as well as bibliographical material by James Goddard (1970) and by David Pringle (1994), and includes copies of some occasional commentaries on the author's work","Acquired June 2010 from the Ballard family under the Acceptance in Lieu (AIL) scheme"

Initial treatment (typed) prepared by Harley Cokeliss for BBC approval to progress the film. The narration combines extracts from Ballard, The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), and extracts from an interview conducted by Cokeliss on 18 October 1970. (5 x A4 photocopy sheets.); (2). Typed letter signed from Ballard to Cokeliss, 3 December 1970 (2 sheets). 'Am still working on the script, which should be with you by monday morning. However, from your point of view here are the basic scenes which you will need, either for live filming with myself, or from existing newsreel material.' Ten numbered 'scenes' follow, the first six of which are marked with an asterisk (blue ink) as 'those which you might want me to appear in'; (3). Draft script by Ballard. 10 sheets typed [December 1970]. The draft is entitled: 'Crash', prepared 'for Harley Cokeliss / Review / BBC-TV'. The first page of the script is annotated in the hand of Cokeliss, against the scene 'Ballard driving his car along highway': 'shoot at Dusk just as lights goes [sic] on'; (4). 'Camera Script'. BBC document (9 sheets, yellow paper). The Camera Script includes the introduction by the programme's editor and presenter, James Mossman ('Jim'). Transmission: 12 February 1971; (5). The papers relating to the film are supplemented by a contemporaneous document originally in Cokeliss's possession: the 'Author's proof' of an interview with J. G. Ballard published in Penthouse, Vol. 5, No. 5 (1970), pp. 26-30. The proof comprises 7 long sheets. The corrections (in blue ink) are typographic. Annotations to the proof do not appear to be in Ballard's hand (e.g. question reformulated, green ink, sheet 5). The interviewer (styled in the proofs as simply 'Penthouse') was Lynn Barber. The interview as published is reprinted in Sellars and O'Hara (eds.), Extreme Metaphors: Interviews with J.G. Ballard 1967-2008 (2012). However, there are some remarks by Ballard in the proof (sheets 1, 4, 5, 6, 7) that were not included in the published interview",""

'The play is expressed through (1) a continuous film projection of automobiles in all their roles, from show-room to car-wash, motorway to Kennedy assassination, the Mansfield death to the car-crusher; (2) a crashed car on-stage, surrounded by plaster dummies, forming a Keinholz-type [sic] tableau; (3) a narrative space involving five actors' (ff.. 2-3). The artist referred to in this description is Edward Kienholz (1927-1994). The performance, to be narrated by Chris Evans, did not take place, although it was publicised in advance in a feature article in the Sunday Mirror (19 May 1968) by June Rose: 'Dr Christopher Evans, an experimental psychologist, and science fiction writer James Ballard have spent many months exploring the 'hidden meaning' of car accidents for their dramatic presentation entitled Crash [...] Sculptor Eduoard Palozzi [sic] will make the dummy figures for Crash, and Dr Evans will narrate and explain the significance of the action on stage.'. Each folio is stamped 'Dr Chris Evans'. The document is not dated, but reference in the text to the fatal crash of racing driver Jim Clark (see f. 6, the name misspelt as 'Clarke') indicates that the document was completed after 7 April 1968","Donated by Nancy Evans (widow of Christopher Evans), 13 July 2017"
